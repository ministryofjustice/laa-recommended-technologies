# Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

## Introduction

Continuous Integration 

## Motivation

The motivation for CI/CD can't be better summed up by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration):

> Continuous Integration brings multiple benefits to your organization:
>
>- Say goodbye to long and tense integrations
>- Increase visibility enabling greater communication
>- Catch issues early and nip them in the bud
>- Spend less time debugging and more time adding features
>- Build a solid foundation
>- Stop waiting to find out if your codeâ€™s going to work
>- Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly
>
>### What is continuous integration?
>
> Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early." - Source:

> Continuous Deployment is closely related to Continuous Integration and refers to the release into production of software that passes the automated tests. - Source: [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration)
